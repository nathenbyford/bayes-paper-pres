# Introduction

## What is Under-Reporting?

- Consider count data with true counts $y_i$
    - If $y_i$ is perfectly observed, the counts can be modeled by an appropriate conditional distribution $p(y_i | \boldsymbol{\theta})$
    - Usually either Poisson or Negative Binomial
  
:::{.fragment}
- In some cases the true counts are not observed, but instead $z_i$ are observed such that $z_i \le y_i$
- Using the conditional distribution above on the observed counts $z_i$ can bias the results of the model if under-reporting is not accounted for

:::


## Motivation

- TB cases in Brazil can be assumed as under reported from previous research for a few reasons
    - Under developed rural regions
    - Immature disease tracking infrastructure
    - High cost of testing
    - etc.

- This paper attempts to build a model so that the severity of under-reporting is estimated and potentially informed by available covariates that relate to the under-reporting mechanism [@stoner_hierarchical_2019]


## Observed data 

:::{.columns}
::::{.column width=50%}
- Sub region data of TB cases
- Annual cases from 2012 - 2014
- The TB detection rate was estimated at 91%, 84%, and 87% in Brazil from 2012-2014[^1]
- Spatial clustering

## Previous methods

1. Using validation data
  - Use a more accurate data set to build a model based on the error prone data
  
:::{.fragment}
2. Censored Likelihood methods
  - Use standard likelihood with indicator variable for full reporting
  - Requires information to determine indicator of under-reporting
  - Possible to use a threshold if no information about under-reporting counts
:::


## Censored likelihood

The censored likelihood is written as

:::{.def}
$$
p(\boldsymbol{y} | \boldsymbol{z, \theta}) = \prod_{I_i=1} p(y_i|\boldsymbol{\theta}) \prod_{I_i = 0} p(y_i \ge z_i | \boldsymbol{\theta})
$$
:::
Where $I_i$ is the indicator for which data are under reported.

- $I_i = 1$ when $z_i = y_i$
- By accounting for the under reporting in the model design, a more robust inference on $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is possible

:::{.aside}
When no information is available we can threshold to get values of $I_i$.

# Model

## The Poisson-Logistic model

- Instead of using an indicator variable, consider a continuous range [0,1]
    - This can be considered as the proportion of true counts
- Using a hierarchical model consisting of:
    - A binomial component on the observed count $z_i$ 
    - A latent Poisson model for the true counts $y_i$
- The Poisson-Logistic has been used across many fields; economics, criminology, natural hazards, epidemiology[^2], etc.

## Poisson-Logistic model {.smaller}

The Poisson-Logistic or Pogit model is given by
\begin{align*}
z_i | y_i &\sim \text{Binomial}(\pi_i, y_i) \\
\log \left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) &= \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{J} \beta_j w_i^{j} \\
y_i &\sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\
\log(\lambda_i) &= \alpha_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\alpha_k x_i^{(k)}
\end{align*}

- The vectors $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_K)$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_0, \ldots, \beta_J)$ are parameters to be estimated
- Mean-centered $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ permit that $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ are interpreted as the mean of $y_i$ on the log scale, and the mean of the reporting rate $\pi_i$ on the logistic scale, with the covariates at their means

## Extended model {.smaller}

Let $z_{t, s}$ be the observed (under reported) counts, $y_{t, s}$ be the true unknown counts, $\pi_s$ be the under reporting rate, and $\lambda_{t, s}$ be the Poisson mean.

:::{.def}
The hierarchical model from the paper is
\begin{align*}
z_{t, s} | y_{t, s}, \gamma_{t, s} \sim \text{Binomial}(\pi_s, &y_{t, s}) \\
&\downarrow \\
&y_{t, s} | \phi_s, \theta_s \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{t, s}).
\end{align*}
Where $\pi_s$ and $\lambda_{t, s}$ are defined as 
\begin{align*}
\log\left(\frac{\pi_s}{1 - \pi_s}\right) &= \beta_0 + g(u_s) + \gamma_{t, s} \\
\log(\lambda_{t, s}) &= \log(P_{t, s}) + a_0 + f_1(x_s^{(1)}) + f_2(x_s^{(2)}) \\
  &\quad + f_3(x_s^{(3)}) + f_4(x_s^{(4)}) + \phi_s + \theta_s.
\end{align*}
:::

## Link functions {.smaller}

Taking a closer look at the link functions for $\pi_s$ and $\lambda_{t,s}$,

:::{.def}
\begin{align*}
\log\left(\frac{\pi_s}{1 - \pi_s}\right) &= \beta_0 + g(u_s) + \gamma_{t, s} \\
\log(\lambda_{t, s}) &= \log(P_{t, s}) + a_0 + f_1(x_s^{(1)}) + f_2(x_s^{(2)}) \\
  &\quad + f_3(x_s^{(3)}) + f_4(x_s^{(4)}) + \phi_s + \theta_s.
\end{align*}
:::


Where; $u_s$ = treatment timeliness, $P_{t, s}$ = population,  $x_s^{(1)}$ =  unemployment, $x_s^{(2)}$ = urbanization, $x_s^{(3)}$ = density, and $x_s^{(4)}$ = indigenous.

Residual spatial variation in the Poisson mean $\lambda_{t,s}$ is captured by unstructured random effects $\theta_s$ and structured effects in $\phi_s$. 

## Link functions {.smaller auto-animate=true}

Taking a closer look at the link functions for $\pi_s$ and $\lambda_{t,s}$,

\log\left(\frac{\pi_s}{1 - \pi_s}\right) &= \beta_0 + g(u_s) + \gamma_{t, s} \\
\log(\lambda_{t, s}) &= \log(P_{t, s}) + a_0 + f_1(x_s^{(1)}) + f_2(x_s^{(2)}) \\
  &\quad + f_3(x_s^{(3)}) + f_4(x_s^{(4)}) + \phi_s + \theta_s.
\end{align*}

Residual spatial variation in the Poisson mean $\lambda_{t,s}$ is captured by unstructured random effects $\theta_s$ and structured effects in $\phi_s$. 

An ICAR[^3] model was assumed for the structured spatial effect $\phi_s$ with variance $\nu^2$.

Normal models were assumed for $\theta_s$ and $\gamma_{t, s}$ with variance $\sigma^2$ and $\epsilon^2$ respectively.

# Results

## Simulation Results
- Simulated data with spatial correlation and under reporting
- In sensitivity analysis it was found that the model with no completely observed values is robust in terms of quantifying uncertainty
    - As long as the practitioner specifies a prior for $\beta_0$ that is informative
